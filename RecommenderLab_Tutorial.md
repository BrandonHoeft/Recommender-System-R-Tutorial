## Introduction

This is an introduction to building Recommender Systems using R. The major CRAN approved package available in R with developed algorithms is called `recommenderlab` by Michael Hahsler. Latest [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recommenderlab/recommenderlab.pdf) and a [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recommenderlab/vignettes/recommenderlab.pdf) are both available for exploration. The code examples provided in this exploratory analysis came primarily through the material on Collaborative Filtering algorithms from this package, explored in the book [*Building a Recommendation System with R*](https://smile.amazon.com/Building-Recommendation-System-Suresh-Gorakala/dp/1783554495/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1507314554&sr=8-1&keywords=building+a+recommendation+system+R), by Suresh K. Gorakala and Michele Usuelli. 

## Collaborative Filtering

The focus of this analysis will center around [*collaborative filtering*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering), one of the earliest forms of recommendation systems. The earliest developed forms of these algorithms are also known as *neighborhood based* or *memory based* algorithms, described below. The basic idea of collaborative filtering is that we have a ratings profile for each user or purchaser of some service. These data can be used to impute or predict missing ratings to form the basis of new recommendations for services/products not yet purchased.

Under *user-based collaborative filtering*, we can use the ratings or purchase behavior from all users, develop measures of similarity between users. After identifying the nearest neighbor(s) of each user profile, we'd be able to impute or predict missing ratings of each user based on some weighted average of most similar users and the types of services/products (referred herein as items) they've rated that are new to the individual user. 

An inverted approach to nearest neighbor based recommendations is *item-based collaborative filtering*. Instead of finding the most similar users to each individual, an algorithm assesses the similarities between the items that are correlated in their ratings or purchase profile amongst all users. 

* *Data Requirements*: a user ratings profile, containing items theyâ€™ve rated/clicked/purchased. A "rating" can be defined however it fits the business use case.
        	
* *Strengths*: simple to implement, and recommendations are easy to explain to user. Transparency about the recommendation to a user can be a great boost to the user's confidence in trusting a rating. 
 
* *Weaknesses*: these algorithms do not too work well on very sparse ratings matrices. These algorithms will not work from a cold start since a new user has no historic data profile or ratings for the algorithm to start from. 

Some additional starter articles to learning more about collaborative filtering can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-recommender1/) and here(http://recommender-systems.org/collaborative-filtering/).
